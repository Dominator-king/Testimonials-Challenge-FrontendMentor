## My process
- Started from the basic layout to make the divs and align them using flexbox.
- mobile-first design with a breakpoint at 576px.
- then added background colors and text designs etc.
- went onwards to desktop design.
- finally added the images and finalized the project. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Effective use of html div and css stylings, especially flexbox and its basic properties. 
- Learned how to work with images and their manipulation.
- Got comfortable with different style properties of div elements


### Continued development
Further learing of css flexbox and grid aswell as moving into more advanced websites including decent amount of Javascript to make real-life practical functioning websites.
